# Java For Rails Developers

## About the Author

Lucas Moore is a professional software engineer living in Denver, Colorado who has been interested in coding and computers since junior high. He has deep knowledge of what it takes to build and maintain a production Ruby on Rails application with millions of active users. Lucas completed the Flatiron School’s Learn Program and then was asked to stay on to teach Ruby on Rails. Prior to engineering, Lucas taught bilingual elementary school through Teach for America after studying Journalism and Spanish at University.

Lucas is currently working on breaking a six-year-old Rails Monolith into micro-services, including Java. This book leverages his experience programming, writing and teaching and documents what he has learned so that you can use what you already know about writing Ruby on Rails to get up and running with Java in no time at all.

## Why This Book?
It is time to learn Java. If you are anything like me, you may be  initially intimidated by the prospect. When I finished learning Ruby on Rails out of code school, job postings that required Java experience felt unapproachable. At the time, I believed that Java had a connotation of icky enterprise software and boring, obscure code.

I know now that my preconceived notions about Java were completely wrong. You’ll find within this book that Java is quite nice and extremely similar to Ruby on Rails projects. It's also powerful and a well-paved road to development of software that runs on a huge scale.

The purpose of this book is to teach you how to write Spring projects in Java, to speak the language with all the right vocabulary, to understand the moving parts and to level up your career.

I am taking the lessons of my prior career in education and applying them to the writing of this book. So rather than approaching Java from the perspective a complete beginner, I will accesses your prior knowledge of Rails projects and conventions. The result, if I am successful, is that  you will find this Ebook to be a quick journey of learning a new vocabulary around the concepts you already have a grasp on as a Rails developer, in addition to some new concepts.

## How This Book is Organized
The curriculum of this book is designed to enable you to connect Ruby concepts you already know to their Java counterparts. The files in the zip folder all correlate to a specific chapter and are labeled as such.

Throughout the book. you'll see code snippets. These examples are meant to look like the Ruby and Java code you'll see in your editor or IDE.

When it comes time to run code, you'll see lines in Ruby code samples start with `>`, just like you'll see if you open an `irb` console in your terminal. Also in Ruby, you'll see `=> Something` which indicates what the `return` value is for the Ruby statement on the line above.

For Java, the code in snippets is not compiled, but more on that later.

This book also will say what language is present above the snippet, though soon you'll get a feel for the conventions and will be able to spot the language based on its features.

```ruby
# Ruby
> hello_world = "Hello World"
=> "Hello World"
```

In Java, we have similar code below.

```java
// Java
String helloWorld = "Hello World";
```

You'll also notice vocabulary terms that are *italic*. If you're a note taker, these would be the things to write down or to make flash cards about. There is also a glossary at the end of the book with the vocabulary to review.

By the end of this book, after learning Java syntax, Spring conventions, new vocabulary and more, we have two projects to examine - one is a finished Ruby on Rails project and the other is an un-started Spring Project. We’ll work through the Spring project together and end up with a polished finished project together! Project based learning is the best way to make things tangible.
