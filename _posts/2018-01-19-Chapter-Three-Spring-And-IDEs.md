Now that we know a bit about Java, let's talk about the industry standard framework most Java projects are built with: Spring!
Once we get a feel for what Spring does, we'll generate a project and get it running! One major difference between Ruby and Java is that Java development heavily relies upon an integrated develop environment, most commonly called an IDE. So we'll get our IDE set up too.

# What is Spring?

Spring is a framework maintained by Pivotal that bundles years of best practices and conventions together, much like the way Rails' goal is to get you up and running as soon as possible. There are a few distributions of Spring, but we'll focus on the easiest and most popular distribution, Spring Boot.

Here's what [Spring.io](https://spring.io/) has to say about Spring Boot.

```
Spring Boot is the starting point for building all Spring-based applications.

Spring Boot is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration of Spring.

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

# Choosing an IDE

I can hear you complaining from here. "Why can't I use Atom or VScode?"

## Eclipse

## IntelliJ
