# Java for Rails Developers Book

This is a vanilla jekyll project.

I am writing it in markdown for the code formatting. You can use Atom's Markdown Preview as one option.
The next option is to run `jekyll serve` and open up `localhost:4000` in your browser.

For the final book, it will be all put into one file and rendered to a PDF.
